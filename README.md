# InspirationalQuoteAI
This is a small llm that takes a quote json and generates inspirational quotes based on them

Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akmittal/quotes-dataset

# Set Up
Just download the dataset and unzip it into a folder with the python files and run the quotePreprocess.py file and then the quotetainandtest.py to see the generated results

# Future plans
I hope to upload the model as a pth file for others to use so they don't have to train their own models to test out this code. I am also hoping to make a more user friendly expereince to using my code
